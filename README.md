Hello World!

Hello humans (or should I say hello bots, isn't everyone else in reddit a bot but me?, my name is Jose Javier Bracho, or JJ for short, I am embarking in this beautiful world of coding looking for a bigger challenge in my career, hoping to make the jump to the tech industry which has always exited me.

I have a big passion for videogames, baseball and good media (mostly nerdy things and some good critically aclimed dramas). 

I live in Toronto with my wife and we like to do cool things together like rollerblading, hiking, eating out and just being silly together. 

I hope I am able to call you all my collegues soon!

Happy coding.

JJ
